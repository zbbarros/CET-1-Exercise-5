# CET-1-Exercise-5

1. Iteration 
    The initial script that created a table allowing me to read off Uo at convergence and observe the constrained values. The design criteria could be easily altered to see what arrangement gave the largest value of Uo (and hence smallest Ao).

2. Convergence
    The Iteration script found Uo to the nearest multiple of 5. This script is the same but without the for loop; it allowed me to more precisely calculate Uo for the chosen configuration and again check the constraints.

3. Design
    This script is different to the previous two in that it doesn't use a trial value of Uo. Instead the design decisions are used to calculate both the area and overall heat transfer coefficient. The nozzle pressure drops have been included for the first time - they didn't affect the results.
